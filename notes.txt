  after creating the folder
    create a package.json file: npm init -y
    install openAI: npm install openai
    we need to install dot EnV package, we wil use it to create a DOT EnV file which will store our openAI api key. We do not want to store the key in our node code directly. It is a matter of security.
      install dot EnV: npm install dotenv --save
    create index.js and env: 

    In the env file:
      we have to bring in an environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY="";

   ok... I could not get the apikey to work. I kept getting an error: Invalid api key. After some troubleshooting:
     OPENAI_API_KEY="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";
     OPENAI_API_KEY=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

     the second one was correct. I had the ";" at the end of the key and it was adding that as the key. I found this out by just adding the key directly to the code instead of using the .env file.
     I have the prompt working in the cmd prompt. I just need to fix this error with the "require" so I can use the console on the browser.

    Use a bundler like webpack or parcel
      npm install -g parcel-bundler
    
    Ok. so I shouldnt make api calls to OpenAI directly -or anything directly- from the client side browser. It is not recommended. It will expose your api key. I need to make the api call from a server side
    environment -my computer- nodejs. I have to create a server.js -a node server- use a library -express- to handle the api call. Then use the client side JS to display the results.
     install express: npm install express
